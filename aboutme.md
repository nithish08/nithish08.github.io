Hi, I'm Nithish.

I am passionate about large-scale machine learning and low-cost deployment for neural networks. My contributions to scikit-learn, an open-source machine learning package, widely adopted by organizations and individuals globally. I love writing and sharing clear concepts to help others understand complex topics.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology and a Master's degree in Data Science from the University of San Francisco. My fascination with mathematics since childhood, combined with my engineering education, has provided me with the rigor needed to think quantitatively and solve complex problems.

In my professional journey, I've been fortunate to build machine learning solutions for a diverse set of problems across various industries.

Outside of my professional interests, I love playing outdoor sports. I regularly play cricket and soccer, which help me stay active and balanced.
